My name is Paul and I am a Ph.D. student at the University of Washington in the Department of Mechanical Engineering. I am currently developing my skills in model-predictive manufacturing, control systems, and precision instrumentation at the MACS Laboratory under the Supervision of Professor Xu Chen (https://macslab.xyz/). My most recent work uses experiments paired with numerical modeling to predict the behavior of patented electrohydrodynamic manufacturing processes. Please feel free to browse my list of publications for more information and, as always, please don't hesitate to reach out if you're interested in collaborating!
