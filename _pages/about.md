My name is Paul and I am currently pursuing doctoral studies at the University of Washington in the Department of Mechanical Engineering. I am currently developing my skills in model-based optimal control for precision instrumentation and am currently working on simulations to model and predict the behavior of an electrohydrodynamic manufacturing process that was patented in 2019. Please see my list of publicaitons for more information. As always, please feel free to email me if you're interested in collaborating!
