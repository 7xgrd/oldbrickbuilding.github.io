My name is Paul and I am currently pursuing doctoral studies at the University of Washington in the Department of Mechanical Engineering. I am currently developing my skills in model-based optimal control for precision instrumentation and am working on simulations to model and predict the behavior of a patented electrohydrodynamic manufacturing process. Please see my list of publicaitons for more information. As always, please feel free to email me if you're interested in collaborating!
