My name is Paul and I am a Ph.D. student at the University of Washington in the Department of Mechanical Engineering. I am currently working on model-predictive manufacturing and precision instrumentation at the Mechatronics, Automation, and Control Systems (MACS) Laboratory (https://macslab.xyz/). My most recent work uses experiments paired with numerical modeling to predict the behavior of patented electrohydrodynamic nanomanufacturing processes. Please feel free to browse my list of publications for more information and, as always, please don't hesitate to reach out if you're interested in collaborating!![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b275a4d2-88fb-4c7d-b9d2-96da30a1a2cd)
