excerpt: 'Methods and systems for electrospinning are provided. In a method of electrospinning, a solidifiable fluid is dispensed from a nozzle and biased at a first DC voltage. A fiber stream is drawn from the fluid using a collector biased to a second DC voltage. The fiber stream may be moved orthogonal to a direct stream path using a plurality of inter-electrodes biased to one or more midstream voltages (which may vary over time). The fiber stream is collected on the collector...'
