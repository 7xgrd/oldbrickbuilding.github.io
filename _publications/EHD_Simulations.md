excerpt: 'Electrospinning has been modeled using a Langrangian, as well as an Eularian
approach. Depending on which model is employed, various features of the
electrospinning process may be analytically or numerically studied, e.g. when
analyzing fiber diameter as a function of jet instability and whipping. Numerically,
Reneker et al. proposed a discrete model, which divides the jet into N elements, or
beads, each possessing an individual mass (mi) and charge (qi). In this system,
each bead is interconnected by viscoelastic filaments, which can be generalized by a
spring and dashpot. Here, a positively charged element, mi, among
N adjacent charges, is injected from a positively charged nozzle into an external
electric field. In this scenario, it is evident that the ith bead will be accelerated by an
external electric field, Ei, at each point, which is sometimes approximated by the
voltage on each conductor and/or dielectric within the vicinity of the jet. For a three-
dimensional system, calculating this electric field, Ei, at each coordinate can be
computationally intensive, especially in consideration of each electrode architecture.
However, there are some numerical methods that may be useful for simulation
purposes, e.g. using a boundary element method [4]. Knowing the electric field at
each point then provides the amount of force on the ith bead, where qi is the charge on the ith bead and
Ei is the electric field at the ith coordinate due the surrounding conductors and dielectrics...'
