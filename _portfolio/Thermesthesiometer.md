An advanced thermesthesiometer has been developed for experiments in human-subjective testing and pain threshold measurements in correlation with steady state and transient heat transfer processes. A suitably chosen material with properties similar to human tissue is used for bare skin simulation and is thermally regulated using a programmable logic controller (PLC). An automated driving mechanism provides variable touch-occurences and pressures over several composite test-surfaces, each with varying effusivities, and surface roughnesses.
